# Au poil!

------------

    The project is a creation of a simple TV program that we have called "Bitch.Tv" -- Should be available on devices, tablets, notebook, small, medium and large screens.

### Using Json convert from XML TV channels

We have to download the **new tv program **all the 10 days... This is obvious but we don't have another choice

### Using simple Api.js to select and use the data

The api has been written to show only 19 channels. But it is enough to do the project.
